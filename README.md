#Udacity Resume Project
This was the interactive resume project in Udacity's Nanodegree program. It was also a crash course on Javascript which you can find [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud804).
This project is not intended to be my actual online resume, but an opportunity to create an interactive resume using Javascript. 
####Final Thoughts
Overall this project was a good experience in getting your feet wet using Javascript, and learning to use different JS files, as well as JQuery. It also gave me an introduction to the Google Map API. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in learning.
