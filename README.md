#Udacity Resume Project
This was the interactive resume project in Udacity's Nanodegree program. It was also a crash course on Javascript which you can find [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud804).
This project is not intended to be my actual online resume, but an opportunity to create an interactive resume using Javascript. 
####Final Thoughts
Overall this project was a good experience in getting your feet wet using Javascript, and learning to use different JS files, as well as JQuery. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in learning.
